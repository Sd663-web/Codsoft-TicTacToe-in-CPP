🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe Game in C++
📌 Mini Project | CodeSoft C++ Virtual Internship

This repository contains a console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game developed using C++ as part of Task 1 of the CodeSoft C++ Virtual Internship.

The project demonstrates the practical application of C++ fundamentals, object-oriented programming, and logical problem-solving through a simple yet interactive game.

🛠 Project Overview

The Tic-Tac-Toe game allows two players to play against each other on a 3×3 grid using a console interface.
The game handles player inputs, validates moves, switches turns automatically, and detects win or draw conditions.

✅ Features Implemented

🎯 3×3 console-based game board

👥 Two-player mode (Player X & Player O)

🔁 Automatic turn switching

⌨️ Player input validation (1–9 slots)

🏆 Win detection (rows, columns, diagonals)

🤝 Draw detection

🔄 Replay option after game completion

💻 Technologies & Concepts Used

C++

Object-Oriented Programming (Classes & Objects)

Functions & Modular Programming

Conditional Statements & Loops

Arrays and String Handling

Input Validation & Game Logic
